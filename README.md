JavaScript Learning Module

This repository contains my work and exercises from the JavaScript module Iâ€™ve been studying over the past 4 weeks.
The goal of this module was to build a solid foundation in JavaScript fundamentals, practice writing clean and efficient code, and apply concepts through small projects.

During this module, I covered key topics such as:

Variables & Data Types

Operators & Expressions

Functions (regular, arrow, higher-order)

Control Structures (loops, if/else, switch)

Objects & Arrays

Asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)

DOM Manipulation and basic event handling

The repo contains exercises, code snippets, and mini-projects that reflect my learning journey, 
including examples of synchronous vs asynchronous execution, working with APIs, and simple interactive scripts.
